YOLO-based Arthropod Detection

Overview:
This project implements object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to 
identify arthropods from the Arthropod Taxonomy Orders Object Detection Dataset. 
The Jupyter Notebook (yolo102.ipynb) contains the code to load a pre-trained YOLO model, process images, and detect arthropod species efficiently.

Dataset
Name: Arthropod Taxonomy Orders Object Detection Dataset
Description: This dataset consists of images of various arthropod species categorized into different taxonomy orders.
Usage: The dataset is used to train/evaluate the YOLO model for accurate object detection.

Features
Implements YOLO for real-time object detection
Detects multiple arthropod species from images
Utilizes OpenCV and deep learning frameworks
Outputs bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects

Model
Uses a pre-trained YOLO model (YOLOv3, YOLOv4, or YOLOv5)
Ensure that the YOLO model weights (.pt or .weights) and configuration files (.cfg) are downloaded before running the notebook.

Results
The notebook processes input images and marks detected arthropods with bounding boxes and confidence scores.
